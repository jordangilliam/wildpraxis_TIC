ALEVIN (30-60 days): Newly hatched with large yolk sac attached. Hide in gravel, absorb yolk for nutrition. FRY (60-90 days): Yolk absorbed, 'swim-up' stage. Begin feeding on tiny insects. Develop parr marks (dark vertical bars). JUVENILE/PARR (3-12 months): Grow rapidly, develop adult coloration. Parr marks gradually fade. ADULT (1+ years): Sexually mature, can reproduce.

Gills: Extract dissolved oxygen from water. Require 7+ ppm DO. Lateral Line: Sensory organ detects vibrations and water movement. Swim Bladder: Gas-filled organ for buoyancy control. Coloration: Camouflage from above (dark back) and below (light belly). Spots and markings for species identification."

They're perfectly adapted to PA's coldwater streams but very sensitive to pollution and warming. Brown and Rainbow Trout were introduced in the late 1800s and can tolerate slightly warmer, more disturbed waters. While all three species are valued for recreation, conservationists prioritize protecting native Brook Trout populations in Pennsylvania's headwater streams."
