Develop parr marks (dark vertical bars). JUVENILE/PARR (3-12 months): Grow rapidly, develop adult coloration. Parr marks gradually fade. ADULT (1+ years): Sexually mature, can reproduce.

While all three species are valued for recreation, conservationists prioritize protecting native Brook Trout populations in Pennsylvania's headwater streams."

HIGH NITRITE (>0.25 ppm): 50% water change, add aquarium salt (1 tbsp per 5 gallons), stop feeding, test daily. HIGH NITRATE (>40 ppm): Not emergency but do 50% water change, increase frequency of water changes. INCORRECT pH: Rare in PA tap water. Contact PFBC before adjusting.

HIGH MORTALITY: Check water quality FIRST (temp, ammonia, nitrite, oxygen), look for disease signs, review feeding (overfeeding?), check chiller and filter, call PFBC liaison immediately.
