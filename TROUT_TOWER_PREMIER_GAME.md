# 🐟👑 TROUT TOWER - Premier Flagship Game

## The Icy Tower Experience, Reimagined

**Trout Tower** is your app's **flagship game** - a meticulously crafted, physics-based vertical platformer that captures the addictive smoothness of the legendary Icy Tower, themed around aquatic conservation.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

### Core Concept
Jump up procedurally generated platforms, building momentum and combos as you climb higher. The more consecutive platforms you land on without falling, the faster you move and the higher you can jump!

### Why It's Special
- **Exact Icy Tower Mechanics**: Hold-to-jump-higher, momentum building, combo system
- **Buttery Smooth**: 60 FPS canvas rendering with physics-based movement
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Platforms get narrower as you climb
- **Multiple Platform Types**: Normal, spring, ice, and moving platforms
- **Conservation Theme**: Beautiful water backgrounds, trout player character
- **Deep Strategy**: Perfect landings, combo management, momentum control

## 🎯 Gameplay Mechanics

### Physics System
```typescript
GRAVITY = 0.6               // Tuned for smooth falling
JUMP_POWER = -15            // Base jump strength
JUMP_POWER_BOOST = -18      // With 3+ combo
MAX_JUMP_HOLD = 8 frames    // Hold jump for higher jumps
MOVE_SPEED = 6              // Base horizontal speed
AIR_CONTROL = 0.3           // Control while jumping
FRICTION = 0.85             // Ground friction
COMBO_SPEED_BOOST = 1.2x    // Speed multiplier at 3+ combo
```

### Jump Mechanic (Key Feature!)
1. **Tap Jump**: Short hop
2. **Hold Jump**: Higher jump (up to 8 frames)
3. **Combo Boost**: 3+ combos = even higher jumps
4. **Momentum**: Build speed by landing consecutive platforms

### Platform Types
1. **Normal** (70% chance)
   - Standard blue platforms
   - Get narrower as you climb higher

2. **Spring** (15% chance)
   - Green platforms with ↑ indicator
   - Bounce you 1.5x higher
   - Automatic boost

3. **Ice** (10% chance)
   - Light blue platforms
   - Less friction (slides)

4. **Moving** (5% chance)
   - Orange platforms
   - Slide horizontally

### Combo System
- **Build Combos**: Land on each new platform without falling
- **Combo Benefits**:
  - 3+ combo: Speed boost (1.2x movement)
  - 3+ combo: Power jumps (stronger jump power)
  - Higher combo: More points per meter climbed
- **Break Combo**: Fall significantly below highest point
- **Max Combo Tracking**: Beat your personal best!

### Perfect Landings
- Land within 20 pixels of platform center
- Grants bonus points
- Tracks "Perfect Jumps" statistic
- Shows mastery of physics

### Scoring
```typescript
Base Score = Height climbed × (1 + combo × 0.1)
Total Points = calculateGamePoints({
  baseScore: score,
  combo: maxCombo,
  perfectHits: perfectJumps,
  timeBonus: quickClimbBonus,
  difficultyMultiplier: 1.2
})
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Water-Themed Background
- Gradient: Sky blue → Ocean blue → Deep blue
- Animated wave patterns flowing upward
- Creates underwater climbing atmosphere
- Subtle, doesn't distract from gameplay

### Trout Player Character
**Hand-drawn on canvas:**
- Orange trout body with ellipse shape
- Red spots for realism
- White eye with black pupil
- Orange tail fin
- Flips direction based on movement
- Size: 30×40 pixels

### Platform Design
- Rounded corners (8px radius)
- Shadow beneath for depth
- Highlight on top for 3D effect
- Color-coded by type
- Width decreases with height: `150 - (platformId × 0.5)`

### UI Elements
- **Top Bar**: Height | Score | High Score
- **Combo Display**: Pulsing "🔥 COMBO x[N]!" text with golden glow
- **Control Hints**: Always visible in corner
- **Game Over Stats**: Detailed breakdown with animations

---

## 🎲 Procedural Generation

### Platform Placement Algorithm
```typescript
// Start at bottom
currentY = CANVAS_HEIGHT - 50

// Generate 100 platforms going up
for (i = 1 to 100) {
  // Random gap between platforms
  gap = random(80, 180)
  currentY -= gap
  
  // Random x position (but visible)
  x = random(0, CANVAS_WIDTH - platformWidth)
  
  // Platform gets narrower as you go higher
  width = 150 - (i × 0.5)
  
  // Random type with weighted probabilities
  type = random platform type
}
```

### Gap Tuning
- **Min Gap**: 80 pixels (always reachable)
- **Max Gap**: 180 pixels (requires good jump timing)
- Balances challenge and accessibility

---

## ⌨️ Controls

### Keyboard
- **←→ or A/D**: Move left/right
- **↑ or W or SPACE**: Jump (hold for higher)
- **ESC**: Pause (future feature)

### Control Features
- Horizontal wrapping (go off one side, appear on other)
- Air control (30% of ground control)
- Ground friction for precise movement
- No accidental double-jumps

---

## 🏆 Scoring & Progression

### Point Calculation
```typescript
// Multiple scoring dimensions
basePoints = height / 10
comboMultiplier = 1 + (maxCombo × 0.05)
perfectBonus = perfectJumps × 5
timeBonus = 300 - playSeconds
difficultyBonus = score × 0.2

totalPoints = (base + combo + perfect + time + difficulty) × multiplier
```

### Statistics Tracked
- **Height**: Meters climbed
- **Score**: Real-time score
- **Max Combo**: Highest combo achieved
- **Perfect Jumps**: Center landings
- **Play Time**: Duration in seconds
- **High Score**: Personal best

### Achievements Unlockable
- Combo Master (10+ combo)
- Perfectionist (20+ perfect jumps)
- High Climber (500m+)
- Speed Demon (quick completion)
- Conservation Legend (1000+ score)
